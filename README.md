# Landing Page Project
This project is based on HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript, but it mainly focus on implementations of the DOM manipulations and some other features like **Intersection Observer** API, which provides an easy way to watch and register callbacks to trigger when elements on a page come into view.

### Introduction
This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. It will prepare you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show you how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site.

### Instructions
This project requires you to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

The project will be evaluated according to the Landing Page [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2658/view).

And because it might be a bit challenging having to start from scratch. The project has a [Starter Code](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019), which includes some HTML & CSS code which mean you have to convert it from static to dynamic one using JavaScript.

### The DOM
The Properties and Methods that i've used in this project for manipulating the content and HTML elements to make the project dynamically:
* .getElementById()
* .querySelector()
* .querySelectorAll()
* .createElement()
* .appendChild()
* .addEventListener() -> click event
* .innerHTML property
* .classList property -> .remove() & .add()
* .className property


### ES6
Some of ECMAScript6 features that I'v used in my project:
* Let and Const
* Template Literals
* For...of Loop
